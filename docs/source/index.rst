Welcome to django-yaat's documentation!
=======================================

Django-yaat helps you creating `django-restify-framework <https://github.com/lovasb/django-restify>`_ API endpoints for the
`yaat <https://github.com/slapec/yaat>`_ AngularJS module by providing a simple resource called ``YaatModelResource``.

This class handles column hiding, reordering and data sorting. For most cases where a single Django model is used this
class works out of box however there is some place in it for advanced usage.
